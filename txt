         <TRIVIA QUESTION> 
                                                                    --CSS: display: flex; flex-direction: columns; justify-content: space-evenly
         <OPTION 1>   --> WHEN SELECTED IT CAN TURN CYAN 
         <OPTOIN 2>   --> IMPLEMENT A DELAY AND THEN TURN BOX TO 
         <OPTION 3>     --> RED IF == WRONG ANSWER 
         <OPTION 4>       --> GREEN OR CONFETTI IF RIGHT ANSWER 
                            --> ALSO CHANGE TRIVIA QUESTION DIV INNER HTML 
                                BY PASSING A RANDOM ARRAY WITH POSITIVE OR 
                                    NEGATIVE REPLIES IF RIGHT OR WRONG
                        --> ALSO WANT THEIR TO BE MUTABLE GAME MUSIC 
                        --> IF RIGHT ADD + POSITIVE SOUND EFFECTS 
                            --> I'M THINKING MIGOS ADLIBS 
                        --> IF WRONG --> HEINOUS SOUND BITES 
        //TRANSITION TO NEW SET OF QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS//

        JAVASCRIPT SIDE OF THINGS --
        FETCH TRIVIA DATASET // THERE'S AN API THAT HAS M/C TRIVIA. IT LOOKS LIKE IT COMES WITH ITS OWN STYLING. MAYBE THAT CAN BE OVERWRITTEN THO? THE BENEFIT IS THAT IT WILL LOAD INCORRECT ANSWERS THAT LOOK SIMILAR, THAT'S HARD TO DO BY THROWING IN RANDOM STRINGS. RIGHT ANSWERS WILL BE TOO OBVIOUS 

        THIS IS SIMILAR TO TIC-TAC-TOE ARRAY. RUNNING AN ARRAY THROW A LOOP AND LISTENING FOR CLICKS. DOING MULTIPLE CHOICE ALLOWS YOU TO KEEP SCORE IN LOOP AS WELL

        it'd also be so tight to have a leader board
